            <p>Once you start the game, you will need to mimic the poses in several images of mangas. The sample image
                will
                be shown at the top-left corner, while your pose will be at the bottom-left corner.</p>
            <br>
            <p>To earn scores and trigger the next round, you are asked to keep the correct posture for 2 seconds. If
                you
                cannot make it in 10 seconds, game over.</p>
            <br>
            <p>⚠️Please prepare to step back and show your whole body!</p>
